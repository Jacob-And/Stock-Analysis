# Stock Analysis

### Contributor: Jacob Anderson

#### Overview
##### In this project, I created a Macro in Microsoft Visual Basic that allowed the user to quickly gather information and display it concisely in tables. This code was tested on an Excel workbook, alphabetical_testing.xlsm, to work out any issues on a smaller sample size, before applying it directly to the data in Excel workbook Stock_Data_Project.xlsm

##### This macro properly displays the yearly and percent changes of any stock, along with the total volume of the stock that sold over that year. It also displays the greatest percent increase and decrease of the stocks provided, along with the greatest total volume of stock sold by any given stock in the list. Any stock that has a positive yearly change is highlighted in green, while any stock that went negative is highlighted in red.
